# Escape-the-Mines
Minesweeper-like Math Memory game created in Java. Difference between this and Minesweeper is the algortihm used to generate and clear mines. Unlike Minesweeper, absolute randomness is used, meaning your first hit can be a mine and there is no guarantee that more than 1 block will clear on first hit.
